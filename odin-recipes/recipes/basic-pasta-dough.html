                    <li>As you expand the well, keep pushing th flour up from teh gase of the mound to retain the well shape. the dough will come together when half of the flour has been incorporated.</li>
                    <li>Start kneeding the dough with teh heals of your hands. Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scape up and discard any leftover bits. Lightly reflour the goard and continue kneading for 6 more minutes. The dough should be elastic and a little sticky. Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature before rolling or shaping as desired.</li>
